# Financial Analysis Project: Nike, Inc. & Under Armour, Inc.  

## Overview  
This project showcases two financial analyses I conducted using data sourced from the **SEC EDGAR database (Form 10-K reports)**. The goal was to evaluate **Nike, Inc.’s profitability** and **credit risk**, and then benchmark Nike’s financial health against **Under Armour, Inc.** to make an informed investment recommendation.  

## Profitability Analysis – Nike, Inc.  
I applied the **DuPont Model** to assess Nike’s profitability by breaking down Return on Equity (ROE) into its components:  
- Return on Assets (ROA)  
- Financial Leverage  
- Profit Margin  
- Asset Turnover  

This analysis provided insights into how efficiently Nike manages its assets, controls costs, and leverages equity to generate returns.  

## Credit Risk Analysis – Nike, Inc. vs. Under Armour, Inc.  
To assess financial stability and risk, I analyzed both companies using key credit risk metrics:  
- Times Interest Earned  
- EBITDA Coverage  
- Current Ratio  
- Liabilities to Equity  
- Altman Z-Score  

These metrics helped evaluate liquidity, solvency, and long-term risk. Based on the results, I compared the two companies to determine which presented a stronger investment case.  

## Tools Used  
- **Excel**: For all calculations, ratio analysis, and visualizations  
- **SEC EDGAR**: Source of Form 10-K filings  

## Deliverables  
- Profitability Analysis Report (Nike, Inc.)  
- Credit Risk Analysis Report (Nike, Inc. vs. Under Armour, Inc.)  
- Visualizations and Charts highlighting key financial ratios  

## Key Takeaway  
This project strengthened my ability to perform **financial statement analysis, credit risk evaluation, and investment recommendations** using real-world company data.
